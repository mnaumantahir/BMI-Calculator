## What is BMI?
Body Mass Index(BMI) is value derived from person's weight and height. The result of BMI measurement can give an idea about weather a person has correct weight for
their height.

## How to Calculate BMI?
BMI calculation is based on simple formula using person's weight and height.
The formula for BMI = kg/m2 where kg is person's weight in kilograms and m2 is their height in meters squared. In simplified format it would be
BMI = (Weight in Kilograms)/(Height in meters * Height in meters)

For example if person's weight is 68kg and height is 172cm then
BMI = 68/(1.72*2) = 23

BMI calculator indicate whether person falls under healthy weight, underweight or overweight. If person's BMI is out of healthy range, their health
risk may significantly increases.

BMI Range for adults
BMI : weight status
Below 18.5 : Underweight
18.5 – 24.9 : Normal or Healthy Weight
25.0 - 29.9 : Overweight
30.0 & above: Obese

## Doctors uses BMI too for
evalution for diet and physical acitivty
cadiovascular disease and other health related problems
measure fat in body

## Health risks for extra weight
raises blood pressure and cholesterol and triglyceride levels
it can make diabetes and other health problems
hypertension or high blood pressure
type 2 diabetes
coronary heart disease
gallbladder disease
osteoarthritis
sleep apnea and respiratory problems

## Health risks for under weight
malnutrition, anemia or vitamin deficiencies
osteoporosis from too little vitamin D and calcium
Decreased Immune System
fertility issues caused by irregular menstrual cycles
growth and development issues in children and teenagers

## Who shouldn't use a BMI calculator
BMI should not be used for muscle builders, athletes, pregnant women, the elderly or young children.
This is because BMI does not take into account whether the weight is carried as muscle or fat it's just the number. Those with a higher muscle mass, such as athletes, may have a high BMI but not be at greater health risk. Those with a lower muscle mass, such as children who have not completed their growth or the elderly who may be losing some muscle mass may have a lower BMI.
